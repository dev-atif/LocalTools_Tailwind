            eBay Classifieds is an online classifieds market. Buyers and sellers
            come together online, negotiate, buy and sell. Registration takes
            place by entering an email address and a password. The contracting
            parties transmit personal data such as name, address or telephone
            number directly if they have agreed on the process.

            In many cases, the goods are picked up personally or the service
            provided and paid for in cash on site. This is usually the safest
            way of processing. If you are unable to pick up an item from the
            seller, eBay Classifieds offers you the "secure payment" function in
            many cases. This protects both buyers and sellers and is offered by
            our partner Online Payment Platform (OPP). You can find more
            information about this featurehere.
